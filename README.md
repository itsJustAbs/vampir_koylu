bin has the old code (if u realy wanna see the first version) lib has the real code

run vampir_koylu.dart to see the code work and you can see the code work and

go add or remove users from user_model.dart to see how the code reacts to amount of

users or maybe change the algorithm and see how it works there is 3 options which is

AssignRolesBasic(); , AssignRolesMid(); and AssignRolesExpert(); you can copy these


here and put each one of them in void main and see how each one works 

user model is ready to be made for online but need to perfect algorithms first 

before makeing the game ready for online lobbies


yes I am suprised too it works but I wont upload not working code so not supriseing
to anyone :D
